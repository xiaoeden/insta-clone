- Added AuthForm
- Added LoginForm and SignupForm, which are nested in the AuthForm
- Added LogoButton, which is a button with a Facebook logo before the text
- Added Facebook icons from https://about.meta.com/brand/resources/facebook/logo/, the icon downloaded from this link is a rounded icon, but I couldn't find a square icon that's free so let's just roll with the rounded one
